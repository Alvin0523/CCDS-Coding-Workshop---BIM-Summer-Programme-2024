### Download Python

For most modern computers, a version of python should already be installed. 

!! Checking if Python is already installed
=== "Windows"
    ``` shell
    todo
    ```

=== "MacOS"
    ``` bash
    # 1. open terminal
    python -V # if the following results in an error, try
    # 2. type in the following
    python3 -V
    ```

If python does not exist, visit this [page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download it.

Once download and installion is complete, retry checking if Python is installed.

### Introduction to Google Colaboratory
Google Colab is a document that allows you to write, run, and share Python code within your browser. It is built around Project Jupyter code and hosts Jupyter notebooks without requiring any local software installation. Google Colab only supports Python.

#### Create a document
Access Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com). Once loaded, select "File" at the top left corner, then select "New Notebook". If a box pops up upon loading the site, select "New Notebook" to create a new document.

#### Basic Functions
After creating a new notebook, you will see an empty code cell where you can enter Python codes and execute them at any time. Execution of code can be done by:
- Clicking on the play button on the left side of the cell, or
- by pressing Command/ Ctrl+Enter on your keyboard

To generate a new code cell, hover over the top/ bottom of your current code cell and click on the "+ Code" button. The "+ Text" button will generate a text cell.
- The text cells are formatted using a simple markup language called Markdown.

    *Shift+Enter will run your current cell and generate a new code cell.*

When a cell is selected, a toolbar will appear at the top right corner of the cell. It contains functions specific to the cell including moving the current cell up or down, adding comments, deleting the cell, etc.

#### Sharing your Colab notebook
Colab notebooks are stored in Google Drive, and they can be shared just as you would with Google Docs or Sheets. Simply click the Share button at the top right of any Colab notebook.
- The full contents of your notebook will be shared. You can omit code cell output from being saved or shared by using Edit > Notebook Settings > Omit code cell output when saving this notebook.

#### Opening up a closed notebook
In the [Colab page](https://colab.research.google.com), clicking on the logo at the top left of the notebook will show all the notebooks in Drive. 

You can also search for notebooks you have used recently using File > Open Notebook.
